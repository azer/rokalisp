Roka-Lisp is a new lisp dialect written in Javascript, with support for
both serverside and clientside. Its main aim is to provide a pure
functional, Javascript interoperable language for the coders who want to
program the web using LISP.

Currently it's under development and supports basic data structures of
Javascript. Here is a full list of the types Roka Lisp (will) support:

  + Undefined
